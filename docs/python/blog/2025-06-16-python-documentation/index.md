Documentation for `R` is automatically generated and served by `pkgdown` at
[fastcpd.xingchi.li](https://fastcpd.xingchi.li).

To adopt the state-of-the-art documentation practices for Python, several
alternatives are available.

<!-- truncate -->

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io):
  A modern static site generator that supports versioning, localization, and
  theming. It is particularly well-suited for documentation and has a vibrant
  community.

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org):
  A fast, simple, and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared
  towards building project documentation.
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org):
  A documentation generator for Python projects that makes it easy to create
  intelligent and beautiful documentation.
- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org):
  A platform for hosting documentation, built on top of Sphinx, that
  automatically builds and serves your docs.

In the end, we have decided to use Docusaurus for its modern features and
ease of use. It can be integrated with Read the Docs for hosting, and it
supports Markdown, which is a common format for writing documentation.
